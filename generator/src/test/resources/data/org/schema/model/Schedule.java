/**
 * A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly occurring [[Event]]. At a minimum a schedule will specify [[repeatFrequency]] which describes the interval between occurrences of the event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely.
 *       This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also
 *       have start and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited calendar of events.
